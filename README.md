**I'm Ryan (he/they)** - I'm a senior at MIT studying CS, Engineering, and Biology. I focus primarily on full-stack development, but also have a soft spot for design and front-end work. I believe in using software and technology to make the world a better place - whether that's through aiding activism and social reform, supporting education and public services, or even just bringing joy to people in an otherwise difficult time.
