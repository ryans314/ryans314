**I'm Ryan (he/they)** - I'm a senior at MIT studying CS, Engineering, and Biology. I focus primarily on full-stack development, but also have a soft spot for design and front-end work. I believe in using software and technology to make the world a better place - whether that's through aiding activism and social reform, supporting education and public services, or even just bringing joy to people in an otherwise difficult time. 

## My Projects

### [FocusReader](https://focusreader-jlkm.onrender.com/): 
An E-Reader platform that seeks to provide improved accessibility features, robust annotaiton tools, and focus aids. Live at https://focusreader-jlkm.onrender.com/landing
   -  Developed individually over the course of ~4 weeks for a class on Software Design (6.1040).
   -  The application utilizes novel software design techniques developed at MIT's CSAIL ([Concept Design](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/106499))
   -  Development was aided by AI coding tools (Both Copilot and a command line tool created by instructors for the class) at the behest of course staff.

   -  Also conducted needfinding interviews at the start of the project and user testing + next steps for iterative development at the end of the project.
   -  My contributions were aided by non-agentic AI tools, and did not include ai-generated code.
